Source Han Serif üåè
===================
This is the webfont repository for [Source Han Serif][source].  This repository
contains [WOFF][woff] and original [OpenType][otf] files.  No CSS file is
provided.  Please write your own stylesheet which includes only needed
variations and weights to achieve the best performance.  See [what imports
fonts][import] for my blog for example.

These font files can be hotlinked under `https://jdh8.github.io/source-han-serif/`
because [GitHub Pages][ghp] is active in this repository.  Thank GitHub for
sending the header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`.

This repository will be deleted once [Google provides early access][early] to
Noto Serif counterparts.
